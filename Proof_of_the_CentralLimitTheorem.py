Exercise 1.5
If we increase the sample size, the distribution of the sample means will be better approximated to the normal 
distribution. This is in accordance with the central limit theorem. A relatively conservative limit for approximation 
is that n should be  ‚â•  30. Where this limit should be drawn also depends on how different the original distribution 
is from the normal distribution. For example, a uniform distribution can be approximated to the normal one at 
smaller sample sizes than an exponential distribution (Lantz, 2020).
